# M5Stack ATOM TIlt-Game
A very simple game for the M5ATOM Matrix. The internal IMU sensor is used to detect tilt. If the display shows more red pixels than green pixels, the device has to be tilted to the right. If there are more green pixels, then the unit must be tilted to the left.

The game has twelve levels. With each level it becomes more difficult to distinguish whether there are more red or more green pixels on the display.

The unit must be tilted to the right or left depending if more red or more green pixels are displayed. Sounds simple, but there is only a short period of time to think about it. And the times, how long the pixels are displayed, become shorter and shorter. And in the higher levels black and white pixels are added.



As hardware only the M5Stack ATOM Matrix is required. And a USB power source (can be a PC). The M5ATOM has no battery and has to be powered via USB with 5V.
