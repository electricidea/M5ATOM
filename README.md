# M5Stack ATOM projects
Some projects for the M5Stack ATOM

M5ATOM Tilt Game
 * A simple game for the matrix version of the M5Stack ATOM. 
 * Red and green LEDs are shown on the display. 
 * If more red LEDs are shown, the device must be tilted to the right. 
 * If more green LEDs are shown, to the left.
 * There are twelve difficulty levels in which the number of red and green 
 * LEDs differs less and less and the display time becomes shorter and shorter. 
 * If a level is completed with more than 75% correct answers (>18 of 25), 
 * the next level is unlocked.
